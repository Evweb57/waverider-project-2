  DESCRIPTION
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-*/
This project was an exploration of the Bulma Framework using the RESTFUL routes to create an interactive CRUD website for a local business attempting to get online.

Following the documentation, walkthrough on multiple web platforms and self experimentation I have come the site on demo.

Using the routes to gather information from the domain owner to set information such as available works for sale and classes to sign up for. There is also the beginnings of a contact form on the final page, it's prepared to accept and save data. The form is not operational to avoid anyone entering in their information.

The styling was all thanks to Bulma, which is a Framework that allows to quickly design content simply, the colors and fonts can be accessed by using Sass, a technology I considered using but chose to omit for time purposes.

  UNSOLVED
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-*/
-The content is mostly filler.
-The Bulma framework uses Sass, need to learn so I can update colors and fonts.
-The routes are all basic, adding in a deeper functionality would be nice.
-An owner login and logic to hide all the create/edit/delete routes.
-Model relationships would be interesting.
-Project seemed simple overall, was not able to come up with useful JS to add.
